1.  What is Emmet?
    - Emmet is a build-in plugin that allows developers to write HTML and CSS code much faster by using abbreviated syntax.
    - It acts as a code expansion tool, which generates the full HTML structure with just a single key press (usually Tab)
      when you type a short code snippet, significantly speeding up the process.
    - It is a powerful tool for building complex HTML structures.

2.  Difference between Library and Framework
    A Library is a collection of pre-written code that can be used by developers to perform specific tasks.
    A Framework is a structure that provides foundation for building software.

3.  What is CDN? Why do we use it?
    A Content Delivery Network is a network of servers that are distributed around the world, and is designed to provide content 
    based on the user's geographical location.
    It is used to reduce latency and improve website speed for users worldwide. It is particularly used for websites with global reach or
    experiencing high traffic.

4.  Why is React known as React?
    When data in a React application changes, the components that depend on that data are automatically updated, which allows for efficient and
    seamless updates to the user interface. This "reactive" nature of the library is the reason for Facebook to name it as React.

5.  What is crossorigin in script tag?
    In the real world, resources often come from different domains. The crossorigin attribute in the script tag is used to request these resources.
    It allows the browser to fetch resources from other domains while handling premissions. This is important when sensitive or user-specific data
    is involved, ensuring that only the necessary credentials are included.

6.  What is diference between React and ReactDOM?
    React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for creating components and handling state.
    ReactDOM is a package that provides the methods for rendering React components into the browser's DOM, linking React to the actual
    webpage structure.

7.  What is async and defer?
    Async and Defer are boolean attributes which are used along with script tags to load the external scripts efficiently into our webpage.
    -   When async is used, the script is fetched asynchronously while the HTML is being parsed. However, the parsing is paused when the async is
        ready, executed immediately, and then the parsing resumes.
    -   When defer is used, the script is fetched asynchronously during HTML parsing but is executed only after the HTML parsing is fully completed.

8.  What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
    -   The development link includes helpful debuggin tools, detailed error messages and warnings to aid developers during the development phase.
    -   The production link is optimized for perfomance, exluding debugging features and warnings, resulting in smaller file size for better efficiency.
    -   The development link is typically larger and may impact perfomance, whereas the production link ensures that the application runs smoothly in
        the production environment.
